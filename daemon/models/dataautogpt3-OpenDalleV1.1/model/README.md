    John Berkey Style page,ral-oilspill, There is no road ahead,no land,
    Strangely,the river is still flowing,crossing the void into the mysterious
    unknown, The end of nothingness,a huge ripple,it is a kind of wave,and it is
    the law of time that lasts forever in that void, At the end of the infinite
    void,there is a colorful world,very hazy and mysterious,and it cannot be
    seen clearly,but it is real, And that's where the river goes
