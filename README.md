### üî¥ This is an alpha version. Please report any bugs or suggest any improvements.
### üìã Introduction
Introduction: **Bittensor Subnet 17** Flavia, A Decentralized Model Inference Subnet.

The Flavia project is a sub-network of the Bittensor network, focused on decentralized model inference at different scales.
## üîß Installation

**Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the Flavia repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/CortexLM/flavia.git```

**Navigate to the Project Directory:** Change your current working directory to the Flavia project:

```cd flavia```

**Install the Project:** Use pip to install the project. Run:

```pip install -e .```

**Run a miner:**

```pm2 start neurons/miner.py --netuid 17 --wallet.name <coldkey> --wallet.hotkey <hotkey> --sense.base_url http://host:port --sense.api_key (your api key) --logging.debug```

**Run a validator:**

```pm2 start neurons/validator.py --netuid 17 --wallet.name <coldkey> --wallet.hotkey <hotkey> --sense.base_url http://host:port --sense.api_key (your api key) --logging.debug```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Support our Subnet: Assigning weights
As a validator in the Bittensor network, your support is crucial for the success and efficiency of subnets like Flavia. We invite you to consider assigning weights to our subnet, which will significantly contribute to its performance and the overall robustness of the network.

To allocate weights to the Flavia subnet, you can use the ```btcli root weights``` (**SN17**) command.

By assigning weights to our subnet, you play a vital role in enhancing its inference capabilities and overall contribution to the BitTensor network. Your support helps us maintain a high-performance, reliable, and efficient subnet for decentralized model inference.

We appreciate your contribution and thank you for your support in advancing decentralized AI with Flavia.
